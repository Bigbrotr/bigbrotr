# Used by: src/services/initializer.py
# Priority: CRITICAL (must run before other services)

# Verification options for database schema checks
verification:
  extensions: true       # Verify PostgreSQL extensions exist
  tables: true           # Verify database tables exist
  procedures: true       # Verify stored procedures exist

# Expected database schema elements (for verification)

  extensions:
    - pgcrypto           # For hashing functions (digest)
    - btree_gin          # For GIN indexes on tagvalues array

# Seed relays configuration
# Note: Network type (clearnet/tor) is auto-detected from URL
# Note: Duplicate URLs are ignored by the database (ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING)
# Note: File paths are relative to the working directory:
#       - Docker: /app (so data/seed_relays.txt = /app/data/seed_relays.txt)
#       - Local: run from implementations/bigbrotr/
# Note: Batch size is controlled by Brotr's max_batch_size in brotr.yaml
seed:
  enabled: true                    # Enable relay seeding
  path: data/seed_relays.txt       # Path to seed file
