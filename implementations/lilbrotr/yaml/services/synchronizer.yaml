# Synchronizer Service Configuration (Lilbrotr)
# ============================================================================
# Description: Synchronize Nostr events from relays to the database
# Used by: src/services/synchronizer.py
# Dependencies: Monitor must have checked relays first
# Note: Lighter configuration for lilbrotr (fewer concurrent connections)
# ============================================================================

# Cycle interval (seconds between sync runs)
interval: 900.0

# Tor proxy for .onion relays
tor:
  enabled: false
  host: "127.0.0.1"
  port: 9050

# Event filter settings
# Set to null to accept all values for that field
filter:
  ids: null        # null = all ids
  kinds: null      # null = all kinds
  authors: null    # null = all authors
  tags: null       # null = all tags (format: {e: ["..."], p: ["..."]})
  limit: 500       # Events per request

# Time range for sync
time_range:
  default_start: 0           # Unix timestamp (0 = epoch)
  use_relay_state: true      # Use per-relay state for incremental sync
  lookback_seconds: 86400    # Lookback window in seconds (default: 24h, range: 1h-7d)

# Timeouts (seconds)
timeouts:
  request: 30.0              # WebSocket request timeout
  relay: 1800.0              # Max time per relay sync (30 min)

# Concurrency settings (reduced for lilbrotr)
concurrency:
  max_parallel: 5            # Fewer parallel connections
  stagger_delay: [0, 30]     # Smaller stagger window

# Relay source - which relays to sync from
source:
  from_database: true        # Fetch relays from database
  max_metadata_age: 43200    # Only sync relays checked within N seconds (12 hours)
  require_readable: true     # Only sync relays marked as readable
