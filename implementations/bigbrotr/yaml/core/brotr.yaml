# Description: Configuration for Brotr database interface via PGBouncer
# Used by: src/core/brotr.py (Brotr class)

# Connection pool configuration
pool:
  # Database connection parameters - connects to PGBouncer
  database:
    host: pgbouncer
    port: 6432
    database: bigbrotr
    user: admin
    # password: loaded from environment variable DB_PASSWORD

  # Connection pool size and resource limits
  # Note: These are connections to PGBouncer, which then pools to PostgreSQL
  limits:
    min_size: 5              # Minimum number of connections in the pool
    max_size: 20             # Maximum number of connections in the pool
    max_queries: 50000       # Max queries per connection before recycling
    max_inactive_connection_lifetime: 300.0  # Seconds before idle connection is closed

  # Pool-level timeouts
  timeouts:
    acquisition: 10.0        # Timeout for acquiring connection from pool (seconds)
    health_check: 5.0        # Timeout for connection health check (seconds)

  # Retry logic for connection failures
  retry:
    max_attempts: 3          # Maximum connection retry attempts
    initial_delay: 1.0       # Initial delay between retries (seconds)
    max_delay: 10.0          # Maximum delay between retries (seconds)
    exponential_backoff: true # Use exponential backoff for retries

  # PostgreSQL server settings
  server_settings:
    application_name: bigbrotr  # Application name for PostgreSQL connection
    timezone: UTC               # Timezone for PostgreSQL connection

# Batch operation settings
batch:
  max_batch_size: 1000      # Maximum batch size to prevent memory issues

# Stored procedures configuration
procedures:
  # Insert operations
  insert_event: insert_event
  insert_relay: insert_relay
  insert_relay_metadata: insert_relay_metadata
  # Cleanup operations
  delete_orphan_events: delete_orphan_events
  delete_orphan_nip11: delete_orphan_nip11
  delete_orphan_nip66: delete_orphan_nip66

# Query timeouts for different operation types
timeouts:
  query: 60.0               # Timeout for standard queries (seconds)
  procedure: 90.0           # Timeout for stored procedure calls (seconds)
  batch: 120.0              # Timeout for batch operations (seconds)
